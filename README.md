# Token-based Time Tracker

## Project Title
Token-based Time Tracker

## Project Description
The Token-based Time Tracker is a decentralized system that allows users to log their work hours and get rewarded with blockchain-based tokens. Each hour worked is converted into a token that can be stored, transferred, or redeemed as per system policies.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to create a transparent and immutable time-tracking system that incentivizes productivity and fair compensation. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to prevent time fraud and ensure verifiable proof of work.

## Future Scope
- Integration with smart contracts for automated payouts
- Decentralized identity verification for users
- Cross-platform compatibility with popular project management tools
- NFT-based achievements for significant milestones

## Key Features
- Blockchain-based token rewards for work hours
- Secure and transparent logging of work sessions
